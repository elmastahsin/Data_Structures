/*Given an array of buildings and a direction
 that all of the buildings face, return an array
  of the indices of the buildings that can
see the sunset. A building can see the sunset
 if it's strictly taller than all of the buildings that come after it in the direction that it faces.
 The input array named buildings contains positive, non-zero integers representing the
 heights of the buildings. A building at index i thus has a height denoted by buildings[i] .
 All of the buildings face the same direction, and this direction is either east or west,
 denoted by the input string named direction , which will always be equal to either "EAST" or "WEST" .
 In relation to the input array, you can interpret these directions as right for east
 and left for west.
 Important note: the indices in the output array should be sorted in ascending order.
Sample Input buildings = [3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2] direction = "EAST" Sample Output [1, 3, 6, 7] */
